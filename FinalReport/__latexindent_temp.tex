\section{Pre-calculation of robot's coordinates}
\label{sec:optimizaiton_Precalculation}

Calculation of the robot's presence (spatial coordinates that the robot occupies) is rather resources expensive. 
Since the robot's move in space could be regraded as translation, it could be pre-calculated. 
Presences of the robot in different places could be obtained by simple addition of the presence of the robot of same arm configuration
and the difference in the coordinates of their origin point. 


For a neuronal space of size $ 192 \times 18 $,
without pre-calculation, generation of neuronal space takes about : 44.5 s.
With pre-calculation, generation of neuronal space takes about : 0.41 s, the preparation
of coordinates takes about 0.14 s.
